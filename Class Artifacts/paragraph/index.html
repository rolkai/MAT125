    <p>Renowned type designer, Matthew Carter, has this to say about his profession:</p>
    
    <blockquote>
        <p>Our alphabet hasn't changed in eons; there isn't much latitude in what a designer can do with the individual letters.</p>

        <p>Much like a piece of classical music, the score is written down - it's not something that is tampered with - and yet, each conductor interprets that score differently.  There is tension in the interpretation.</p>

    This is           an          example of
    text with a         lot of 
                        curious
                        whitespace.
