        <p>Life is not all that bad, my friend, hmmm</p>
        <p>If you believe in yourself</p>
        <p>If you believe there's someone</p>
        <p>Who walks through life with you</p>
        <p>You'll never be alone</p>
        <p>Just learn to reach out,</p>
        <p>And open your heart</p>
        <p>Lift up your hands to God,</p>
        <p>And He'll show you the way.</p>

        <p>Chorus:</p><br>
        <p>And He said, "Cast your burdens upon Me</p>
        <p>Those who are heavily laden,</p>
        <p>Come to Me, all of you who are tired</p>
        <p>Of carrying heavy loads,</p>
        <p>For the yoke I will give you is easy</p>
        <p>And My burden is light,</p>
        <p>Come to Me and I will give you rest."</p>

        <p>When you feel the world</p>
        <p>Is tumblin' down on you,</p>
        <p>There is no one</p>
        <p>That you can hold on to,</p>
        <p>Just face the rising sun</p>
        <p>And you'll see hope,</p>
        <p>And there's no need to run</p>
        <p>Lift up your hands to God,</p>
        <p>And He'll make you feel all right.</p>
